# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Startup Explorer Client-

Welcome to Startup Explorer Client, a React application designed for an immersive startup exploration experience. 
Leveraging React Context for efficient state management, this client interacts seamlessly with the server to fetch and display startup details. 
The user interface is thoughtfully crafted, featuring visually striking startup cards presented in a grid layout.

Core Features
-Pagination & Grid Layout: Enjoy a smooth browsing experience with pagination, showcasing 20 startup cards per page within an aesthetically pleasing grid container.

-Filters, Search & CRUD Operations: Easily filter startups by investment type and location. Empower users with a search functionality based on startup names. Intuitively perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with modals enhancing user interaction.

-Component Architecture & Readable Code: Maintainable and readable code is ensured through a well-structured component architecture, fostering easy comprehension and future development.

-UI Enhancements: Elevate the user experience with visual elements such as images, gifs for loading, and background images, creating an engaging and visually appealing interface.

-React-datepicker & React-router-dom: Employ React-datepicker for a user-friendly startup creation process and React-router-dom for smooth navigation, allowing seamless integration of additional web pages in the future.

Startup Explorer Client offers a powerful and enjoyable platform for exploring, managing, and interacting with startup data. Dive in and discover the world of startups effortlessly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
